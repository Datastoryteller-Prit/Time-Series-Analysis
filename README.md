## 📌 Project Overview

This research project presents a comprehensive time series analysis of gold prices over a five-year period.  
The objective was to study the underlying patterns in the gold price series, test for **stationarity** and **seasonality**,  
and build accurate forecasting models using both **classical** and **deep learning** techniques.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔍 Stationarity Testing
- Applied the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test to evaluate the stationarity of the series.

### 🔄 Data Transformation
- Performed **differencing** and **smoothing** to prepare the data for model fitting.

### 📈 Seasonality Analysis
- Used **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** and **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)** plots  
  to detect seasonal and lag-based patterns.

### 🧪 Model Development
Implemented and compared the following forecasting models:

- **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
- **Naive Forecasting**
- **Exponential Smoothing**
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

## 📊 Model Evaluation

### ✅ Residual Analysis
- Checked for white noise and autocorrelation in residuals to validate model performance.

### 📉 Statistical Significance
- Conducted **t-tests** on model coefficients to determine statistical relevance.

### 📏 Performance Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
