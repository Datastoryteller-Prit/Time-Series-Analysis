# Time Series Analysis of Gold Prices
Summer Research Project
Supervisor: Prof. Monika Bhattacharjee
Department of Mathematics, IIT Bombay
üìå Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive time series analysis of gold prices over a five-year period. The objective was to explore stationarity, seasonality, and predictive modeling using classical and deep learning techniques.
üß† Methodology
‚Ä¢	Stationarity Testing: Applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to evaluate stationarity.
‚Ä¢	Data Transformation: Performed differencing and smoothing to prepare the time series for modeling.
‚Ä¢	Seasonality Analysis: Used Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to detect seasonal patterns.
‚Ä¢	Model Development:
o	SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
o	Naive
o	Exponential Smoothing
o	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
üìä Model Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Residual Analysis: Assessed model accuracy through residual diagnostics.
‚Ä¢	Statistical Significance: Conducted t-tests to determine significance of model coefficients.
‚Ä¢	Performance Metrics:
o	Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
o	Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
üîß Tools & Technologies
‚Ä¢	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
‚Ä¢	Google Colab
